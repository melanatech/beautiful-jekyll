## My name is Nicole
I'm currently a business intelligence/data visualization consultant working in the DC area. I started this blog to chronicle my adventures to improve my skills in three popular software for data viz. 

#### A few interesting things about me:

- I'm half Jamaican (don't quiz me on Patois though)
- I'm an avid collector of world currency (I currently have paper/coins from 15 countries and counting)
- I **loooooove** board games and card games

Feel free to drop a line if you see something interesting (or confusing) on my blog. I'm happy to chat and learn from others!
