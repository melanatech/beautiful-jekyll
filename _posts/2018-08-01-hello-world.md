I wonder who came up with the whole "Hello, world" thing to teach programming. It's so simple, yet oddly amusing every time I see it. So, this is an introduction to my umpteenth personal blog (please don't try to find any of the more embarrassing ones that are probably still floating around on the internet somewhere) but first professional-ish blog focusing on data visualization. 

I've been working in Tableau for the past few years (Desktop Qualified Associate, whooo!), and I thought it would be interesting to do a comparison of data storytelling across three different platforms over the next year.

#### This is one of my first visualizations that I posted to Tableau Public

Each month I'm going to take a challenge from [Makeover Monday](www.makeovermonday.org), [Workout Wednesday](www.workoutwednesday.org), or [Data for a Cause](https://www.olgatsubiks.com/data-for-a-cause) and compare the ease or difficulty in recreating visualizations in Tableau, Power BI, and Qlik Sense. I know there are a lot of tutorials out there specific to one platform or the other, but I hadn't yet seen any combining tips and tricks for different platforms.

This is going to be an interesting learning adventure for me, but I hope that it becomes useful for someone else as well.

_Until next time folks...._
